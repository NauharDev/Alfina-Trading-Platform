**Meeting Notes: Afina Meeting Week 1**

Met with Kevin and Josh from Alfina Technologies. 

**Overview**

The platform is a B2C SaaS-based trading platform designed to empower retail traders by removing the need for programming in trading strategy development.

The focus is on providing a click-and-drop process for traders to create and test their strategies.

_Types of Retail Traders Targeted_:

1. Discretionary Traders

- Trade independently using personal computers and mental calculations.

- No assistance from any device.

- Decisions are driven by emotions.

2. Semi-Automated Traders

- Utilize data acceleration tools.

- Limited automation with data analysis assistance.

- No full automation, but some algorithmic assistance in decision-making.

3. Algorithmic Traders

- Develop trading algorithms.

- Machine-made trading decisions.

- Typically use Python + C++.

- Very small customer base (<1% of retail traders).

- Most traders in this category have a strong programming background.

**Target Audience**

- The primary focus is on the first two trader types (discretionary and semi-automated traders) since they typically lack programming experience.

- Aim to empower retail traders by allowing them to create better trading strategies without requiring coding skills.

- The platform is not targeted at large financial institutions, as they already have dedicated teams developing proprietary trading technologies.

- etail traders are only expected to have knowledge in Statistics and Finance.

**Platform Features**

1. Strategy Development Sandbox

Allows users to define variables and predictors for their strategies.

Traders can specify their own trading universe (e.g., default to all stock options in S&P 100, but customizable).

Primary signals must be defined by the user, while other parameters have default values.

2. Data Usage & Compliance

The platform will only use historical data, not real-time data.

Not providing financial advisory services, only a research and strategy exploration tool.

Legal restriction: Cannot offer financial advice due to regulatory concerns.

3. Technical Considerations


**Algorithmic Considerations**
- Reinforcement learning is not recommended due to overfitting risks.

- Possible approaches: Genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, and nature-inspired algorithms (e.g., Three-Body Problem from Chinese AI models, Alpha101 developed by WorldQuant).


**Project Management & Next Steps**

_Founder_

- Kevin Li, Founder of Alfina Technologies and Quant Researcher at Rotman.

_Areas of Focus_

- Event studies and Behavioral Finance: Examining how public events impact market trends.

- Winter 2025 Goal: Develop a fully functional MVP.

**Project Management Tools**

- Notion will be used for organizing tasks and progress tracking.

- Discord will be the primary communication channel.

**Next Steps**

- Provide Discord usernames to Kevin Li for access.

- Gain access to Notion for project collaboration.

- Initial backend tasks will be assigned as a performance assessment.

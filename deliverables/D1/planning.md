## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

The "Alfina Trading Platform.” This platform enables traders to develop, optimize, and test trading strategies systematically, without requiring advanced programming skills or extensive statistical knowledge.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target users for this platform include retail traders and small to medium institutional investors. There are two main types of retail traders targeted with Alfina’s product. First, the discretionary traders that are well attuned to theoretical fundamentals. Second, traders that largely use software such as Excel that provide limited automation and data analysis assistance. Both these groups stand to benefit from the automated, programming-free sandbox Alfina provides to make better strategies. 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Right now, traders rely on coding-heavy platforms which require programming expertise, making strategy development inaccessible to many. Others use Excel-based backtesting, which is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks real-world accuracy, or resort to manual chart analysis and paper trading, which is slow, imprecise, and ineffective for optimization. 
The Alfina Trading Platform simplifies trading by providing intuitive, no-code tools for strategy development and advanced backtesting that simulates real-world performance.

Users can effortlessly build, modify, and optimize trading strategies using an intuitive, user-friendly interface without needing to write code. Also, users can backtest their strategies using historical data to see how they would have performed in real markets as well as identify potential risks and optimise their strategies with confidence. The backtesting is fast, accurate, and reflects real-world conditions.


#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

The user stories for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Alfina Trading Platform" include:
As a trader, I want to create and modify trading strategies using an intuitive, no-code interface so that I can develop my strategies without needing programming skills.
As a trader, I want to backtest my strategies using historical market data so that I can see how they would have performed in the past and adjust accordingly.
As a trader, I want fast and accurate backtesting results that reflect real-world conditions so that I can make informed decisions based on realistic performance simulations.

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

The partner has mentioned that he is looking for us to do more frontend-related work in terms of redesigning the Alfina website. The application is built with Next.js and TypeScript and is hosted on Vercel, so we will be using these technologies. We also discussed incorporating more React elements, A UI component library,  and Apache echarts for charting diagrams. On the few backend tasks that the partner has agreed for us to help with, we’ll be working with Polars, Scipy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn and Rust for the data pipeline and metrics generation. For database management, we’ll be working with Postgres and TimescaleDB.

Our Project Manager, Kevin Li, will oversee internal coordination, while our partner’s backend lead will manage the backend team, and Ashwin S will oversee the frontend team.
To ensure everyone contributes, we will monitor progress through Notion, and if a team member is unresponsive or not contributing, we will first reach out via Slack or Discord. If the issue persists, we will have a team discussion and, if necessary, involve the TA or partner to find a resolution. 



## Organisation Details

#### Q11. How does your team fit within the overall team organisation of the partner?
Our team will play a key role in product development, contributing to both frontend and backend features of the Alfina Trading Platform. 

The frontend team will develop the platform webpage, including the landing page, Alfina Academy, user manual, and community, while also implementing the Modular Payload System (MPS) UI and an interactive backtesting dashboard using Apache Echarts. With experience in React, our team will focus on building a functional and user-friendly interface.

The backend team will extend Scikit-learn’s transformation pipeline, develop advanced backtesting metrics (e.g., deflated Sharpe Ratio, event study metrics), and optimize performance using Rust. We may also contribute to data processing and caching improvements using PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and SQLite. With experience in Python, data processing, and machine learning pipelines, our team is prepared to contribute effectively and collaborate with the partner’s team to improve the platform.


#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?
Our project fits into the overall product by completely redesigning the frontend of the Alfina Trading Platform, ensuring that the user interface is both intuitive and visually appealing, aligning with the organization’s new design vision. The redesign will be based on the new Figma wireframes and design system provided by the organization, which will guide us in creating a seamless experience for the target users—retail traders and small to medium institutional investors.

Beyond UI improvements, we will also develop core frontend components, including the landing page, Alfina Academy, user manual, user community, and MPS UI. These features will enhance user engagement and streamline the trading workflow.

By contributing to both UI/UX as well as platform functionalities, our project plays a significant role in refining Alfina’s overall product experience and making its tools more accessible and efficient for all traders. 

## Potential Risks

#### Q13. What are some potential risks to your project?
The main risks for our project include:

1. UI/UX design uncertainty, as designs will not be available until mid-February, requiring us to work with placeholder structures like LaTeX-based variable definitions and symbolic trees. 

2. The MPS is complex, involving multiple features, operators, and transformations, making seamless frontend-backend integration a challenge.

3. The backend relies on Scikit-learn, Polars, Rust, and TimescaleDB, with key features like Monte Carlo-based luck evaluation and time-series cross-validation still in progress. If these are delayed, our integration may be affected.

4. The high learning curve for financial concepts, such as trading rules, backtesting metrics, and position exit conditions, may require additional study using Alfina’s Notion knowledge base.

5. Ensuring user adoption across three trader types—fully discretionary, hybrid, and algorithmic—also presents a challenge, as we must balance functionality with usability. 

6. A tight timeline may make it challenging to complete key features like the MPS UI, backtesting dashboard, and strategy-building tools on schedule. Without careful task prioritization in Notion and regular coordination with the partner, there is a risk of delays or incomplete features.

#### Q14. What are some potential mitigation strategies for the risks you identified?
These are some strategies that will help keep the project on track and aligned with the partner’s goals:

- To mitigate UI/UX design uncertainty, we will start development with placeholder structures like LaTeX-based variable definitions and symbolic trees and maintain regular communication with the partner to ensure alignment. 
- To handle the complexity of MPS, we will break it down into smaller, manageable tasks and schedule check-ins for clarification. 
- To address the high learning curve for financial concepts, we will utilize Alfina’s Notion knowledge base and consult with the partner to better understand trading rules and backtesting metrics. 
- Ensuring user adoption requires a focus on clear workflows and step-by-step documentation, with early feedback from the partner to refine usability. 
- To manage time constraints, we will prioritize tasks in Notion, hold weekly standups, and adjust the scope if necessary by identifying must-have vs. nice-to-have features.

At the start of the **Implementation Phase**, the team established a strong technical foundation to ensure smooth development. This included:  

- üöÄ Setting up **authentication systems** with Google and GitHub login.  
- üöÄ Designing a **modular architecture** for user-defined trading rules.  
- üöÄ Establishing a **real-time data update system** for portfolio visualization.  
- üöÄ Developing a **clean and intuitive UI framework** for core pages like the **Model Dashboard, Landing Page, and About Us section**.  

From the beginning, the team focused on **scalability, usability, and real-time performance**, ensuring that each sub-team's contributions would integrate seamlessly into the larger system.

**Trading Rule Builder** (*Nauhar & Shahbaz*)  
**Model Dashboard, About Us & Landing Page** (*Ron & Jakub*)  

### Tech Stack

Here is a summary of the technologies that we are using for this project, as well as our reason for choosing each technology: 
- **Next.js:** A React framework that supports both server-side rendering and client-side rendering, making it easy to develop interactive and high-performing applications. Next.js has an intuitive App router system that enables developers to define new routes simply by adding sub-folders within the App folder. With out-of-the-box features like Tailwind CSS integration and TypeScript support, Next.js is the ideal pick for us and will allow us to build a scalanble and maintainable frontend system.
- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a statically-typed version of JavaScript that enforces data type constraints during development. TypeScript's type safety checks help catch bugs before runtime, saving developers a lot of time (and a lot of console.log() statements). These factors made TypeScript seem like the ideal language to use when building scalable frontend systems, which is why the team adoped this language.
- **React.js:** The team decided to choose React.js primarily because we all have experience using it for previous projects. On top of this, React.js is one of the most tried and tested JavaScript libraries for frontend development, and it is commonly used in industry. Its component-based architecture allows developers to package chunks of HTML into functions that can be neatly reused as components across the application, ensuring consistency and organization across the codebase. The virtual DOM also improves performance by minimizing changes to the real DOM.
- **OAuth:** We chose to use OAuth to enable login from third-party accounts like Google and Github. Logging in using third-party providers improves the user experience as users do not have to go through the entire account creation process. Addtionally, this method of login also improves security as users do not need to manage a separate password to use our app- they can simply use one of their existing accounts.
- **Firebase Cloud Firestore:** We chose to use Cloud Firestore to store user account credentials when users log into our application directly with email and password (i.e. not through a third party). Cloud Firestore was the optimal choice because they provide automatic hashing of passwords and provides APIs for advanceed authentication workflows, upholding user security while being flexible enough to adapt to a variety of authentication techniques.
- **Tailwind CSS:** The team decided to use Tailwind CSS since we find value in the enhanced development experience that it offers. Instead of having to create separate CSS files for our HTML, we can add styling directly to specific HTML components in the same file that they are being created, making the codebase easier to understand and more compact.
- **Google Cloud Provider:** We are using Google Cloud Provider as it provides an API endpoint to verify the authenticity of Google accounts. We leverage this service when users sign in using Google, and this verification adds another layer of security to our authentication workflow.

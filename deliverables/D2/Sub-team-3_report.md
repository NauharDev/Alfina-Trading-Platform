# Model Dashboard, About Us & Landing Page  

## Team Members  
- **Ron** – Landing, About, Selenium Testing
- **Jakub** – Dashboard  

## Features Built  
- ✅ Designed and implemented the **Model Dashboard** for visualizing portfolio states and active trading rules.  
- ✅ Developed the **About Us** and **Landing Page**, ensuring a clean and professional design.  
- ✅ Integrated **real-time data updates** for the dashboard.  

## What Worked Well?  
- 🎉 The **dashboard** presents key trading insights in a clear and **user-friendly** way.  
- 🎉 The **About Us and Landing Page** have been designed to create a professional and engaging user-facing experience.  
- 🎉 The team effectively balanced **functionality** with **UI simplicity**.  

## Challenges & What Didn’t Work Well?  
- ❌ **Adding advanced animations** to the **Home** and **About** pages was challenging due to the complexity of integrating smooth transitions with dynamic content.  
- ❌ The animations introduced issues with **performance**, especially when loading content dynamically while keeping animations smooth.  
- ❌ Ensuring **real-time updates** without **UI lag** was challenging, especially with multiple active rules.  
- ❌ Some **rule activations** caused **UI inconsistencies** due to **state mismanagement**.  
- ❌ Finding the right balance between **feature-rich design** and **simplicity** while keeping animations fluid was tricky.
- ❌ Creating selenium tests to cover various user stories was a difficult process as we had to create stages to map the journey.

## Improvements for Future Deliverables  
- 📌 Plan **data structures** more thoroughly before implementation to ensure smooth **real-time updates** and animations.  
- 📌 Optimize **state management** to prevent inconsistencies in **rule activation** and improve animation flow.  
- 📌 **Refactor animation code** for better performance and smoother transitions, especially when content is loaded dynamically.  
- 📌 Conduct **usability testing** to refine data presentation and animations for better **clarity** and user experience.
